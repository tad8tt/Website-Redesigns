The Union Bank app, like many banking apps, allows users to check their credit score and see how they are doing in the various criteria that make up a credit score. Near the top of the screen on the Original version, the user can look at different pages to see how the different criteria such as payment history and account age are helping or hurting their score. The issue with these buttons is that they are only labeled with the "grade" you have in those categories, with no icons indicating what category it even relates to. This severely hinders discoverability and makes this function have almost no information scent.

In my "fixed" version, instead of the cryptic letters with no indication of what is behind the buttons, there are icons which represent each of the credit categories. I used icons consistent with other applications when possible, such as with account age, payment history, and credit utilization, while using simple icons for debt obligations and hard inquiries. In addition, the buttons are labeled with the category they represent. While the "grade" itself has been removed, the colors are still present to represent whether the user is in good or bad shape in that category. If their payment history is poor, for example, it would appear in yellow or red. These changes combine to make this navbar have significantly more information scent, increasing discoverability greatly.
