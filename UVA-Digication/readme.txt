When a user is editing a webpage in the original Digication, a notice at the top of the page lets the user know that their changes have been unpublished. Since the user is almost definitely looking at what they are editing rather than the top of the screen, this is susceptible to inattentional blindness. The page should give some indication near where the user is actually working that they have unpublished changes.

The "fixed" image shows a very rough sketch on how this could be improved. By highlighting the changes made by the user since last publishing and putting the publish changes button on the bottom of each element which has changed, the message is placed exactly where the user is looking, making them unlikely to miss that they have unpublished changes. This eliminates the possibility of inattentional blindness causing a user to leave changes unpublished. The message is still at the top of the screen, though in red error text, for users who prefer to publish all changes on the page at once.
