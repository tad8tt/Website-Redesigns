This is the dashboard page for Honeygain, a piece of software that collects telemetry data in exchange for points which can be cashed out for gift cards. While the animation of the bees around a honeycomb in the original is cute and draws the user's eye towards what is most likely the most important information for the majority of users, the point balance and how close they are to getting a gift card, it distracts users who are looking for any other information. What I believe is going on here is that they are trying to make up for the fact that this page has no discernable visual hierarchy, so they attempt to alleviate this by immediately drawing your eye to this animation, setting the user's focal point to the box with point information. This makes the user unable to easily filter irrelevant information, since filtering moving objects in the periphery is difficult. A relatively simple way to solve this issue is by removing the animation and creating a basic hierarchy where the point information is at the top and the other information is below it. I've edited the styling for the page in the redesign so that you can see how much less distracting the page is when there is a clear visual hierarchy and there's no constant movement on the page. Just the two small tweaks of giving the point counter and graph their own row and killing the animation make the visual hierarchy so much clearer for the user. Honeygain's point counter being set at the top of the page is enough for the user to immediately be drawn to this information, and viewing the other modules can be done without having constant movement in your peripheral vision trying to shift your focal point back to the point counter.
