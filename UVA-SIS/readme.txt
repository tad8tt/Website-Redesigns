Originally, when searching for courses in SIS, key information to students trying to create their schedule is stored on other pages. For example, what requirements a course fulfills on a student's major path is available in the Academic Requirements Report, but, as can be seen in the image above, this information is not displayed when actually looking at a class. This requires the student to have a second tab open with this information in addition to the search. Another piece of information that is only available on other pages is a potential scheduling conflict. This information isn't shown to the student until they attempt to enroll in two classes which are active at the same time, meaning that there is no way to see if there is anything wrong until that point. The course search function lacks the information needed for the task it is meant to facilitate on a single screen. 

It is frustratingly easy to fix this issue, as can be seen in my "fixed" version. Adding a row on the left which features a list of relevant requirements that the course fulfills prevents the student from having to look at their Academic Requirements Report while searching for classes. In addition, the right column displays scheduling conflicts in red so that users can look at different times for those courses right from the search results rather than after trying to enroll. After including these two small tweaks, the interface now presents all info needed for the task of course enrollment on a single screen.
