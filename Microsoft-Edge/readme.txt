When right-clicking anywhere on a webpage in the Original Microsoft Edge, a contextual menu appears with commands which primarily control the webpage as a whole. These include, "Save", "Print", and "Refresh". The issue comes with some of the other commands in the menu, such as the highlighted "Inspect" and "Block Element", which relate to the currently selected element on the webpage, while "Back" and "Forward" are commands which refer to the browser itself rather than the webpage. There is no single object which this menu refers to, so it fails the guideline of only having commands related to the object in focus. In fact, it seems like there is no object that the menu refers to at all, since the commands are a random smattering of frequently used commands without any organization.

My "fixed" version of the contextual menu helps alleviate this issue in a couple of ways. The menu has a triangle pointing to the element, which is highlighted in yellow, for the commands where the specific element is relevant. This is further emphasized with the element being named in the "Inspect" and "Block Element" commands. Combined, this makes the object in focus of the webpage element abundantly clear. 

All of the commands are broken up into either element-relevant commands at the top or page-relevant commands at the bottom. Back, Forward, and Refresh were removed as they aren't contextually significant enough to appear in a contextual menu. The webpage-related commands bear the heading "Page Options" so that the user can easily find these options if they need them. These all make the contextual menu more learnable for all users.
