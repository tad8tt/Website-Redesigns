My redesign attempted to fix all of the broken usability guidelines while maintaining the aesthetic usability effect from the original design; the fact that the screen is mostly
taken up by one piece of content is very aesthetically pleasing, so I decided to keep a part of that while still being economical with space usage.

1. Understand User Goals 
A search box was added to the red-highlighted top-right of the landing page, which helps users whose goal is to find a specific show they already know the name of. This increases
findability for shows and movies.

2. Use Thumbnail Images to Depict Full-size Images Compactly 
Instead of removing the original large piece of content, I chose to take a middle-ground approach to this design, as can be seen in the yellow box. Having one trailer take up most
of the screen helps with the aesthetic usability effect, so I kept it intact. Beyond that, though, there are rows of content separated by category with numerous shows in each
category. This is significantly more economical than the previous design, reducing interaction cost while increasing discoverability of content and user satisfaction.

3. Help People Find Alternatives
The green box above highlights the new filtering system. When the user clicks on each of these categories, they will be taken to a page with only content of that type. This
greatly increases users' ability to find alternatives, now that they can look at all of the options in their favorite genre. This also improves discoverability of content in each
genre and category, as they won't be buried under one monolithic page anymore.

4. Be Consistent
The purple box highlights the "Up Next" feature, which is now actually usable on the web version of Apple TV. I decided to make this feature slightly cover up the full-screen
trailer, since it is likely what most users are looking for when they open the page, and helping it stand out is therefore important. This makes the feature consistent with other
versions of Apple TV as well as within the website, since shows added to Up Next will now appear on the main page. The feature is now learnable for web users and findability of
these shows is drastically improved.

5. Prominently Display System Status
When navigating to a show page, the image that takes up most of the screen is now a preview for the next episode. In addition, the series page now also includes text for the 
season, episode number, and episode title. This helps with displaying system status and removes the need for an extra page for each episode, as highlighted in my demo video. This
simple change now makes it so that the system status is prominently displayed on the page for a series.


Some other, more minor changes include:
The background for content pages is now black rather than gray, making it consistent with the landing page's black background.
The Apple TV+ logo and profile picture are now in the corner, because click targets should be placed closer to the edge.
